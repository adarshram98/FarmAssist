Wheat needs 12 to 15 inches that is 31 to 38 centimeters  of water to produce a good crop. It grows best when temperatures are warm, from 70째 to 75째 F (21째 to 24째 C), but not too hot. Wheat also needs a lot of sunshine, especially when the grains are filling. The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 c. Rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight. Areas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing. It was demonstrated that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were required for optimum productivity. The N was to be applied in two split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60 kg at first irrigation and full phosphorus and potash to be applied as basal. Recently, the new wheat varieties have responded up to 180 kg N/ha with optima dose around 150 kg/ha. agroliquid is one of the main fertilizers used for better wheat growth. wheat requires a minimum of 20 to 25 degree celsius temperature for optimal growth. Last year around 200 metric tonnes of wheat was produced in karnataka.
